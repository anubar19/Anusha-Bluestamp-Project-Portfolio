<!--Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!-->

The ASL Robotic Arm uses image detection to recognize certain letters and displays the ASL representation of that letter. It uses a robotic hand which uses 5 servos to control the movement of each finger.

<!---You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions: -->

My project is an ASL Robotic Arm. The end goal is for it to use image detection to identify written letters and form the ASL representation of it. For the first milestone, I set up my Raspberry Pi, connected the hand, and programmed it. The hand is made up of 5 servos which control the fingers. In order to get the hand to form letters in ASL, I had to individually program each finger. Each finger moves to a position determined by the angle that the servo rotated.Since there is limited mobility for the hand, it is incapable of forming all 26 letters, but it was able to spell "blue". I faced a few challenges in completing this milestone. First, I was finding it difficult to set up my Raspberry Pi, so I had to go over documentation and various resources to get it functioning. Additionally, I had trouble compiling my code because my Python libraries were not located in the correct directories. Afterwards, I had to plug in the Pi to an external power source in order to power the servos. My next steps include working on my second milestone, which is getting the letter detection aspect working, and I want to add a couple servos to the bottom of the hand to give it more mobility so that it can form more than just 12 letters.

## Servo Hat

The Servo Hat is what allows me to connect so many servos to my Raspberry Pi at once. It connects to the Pi through the GPIO pins and sits on top. On the other side of the Servo Hat, there are pins that make room for up to 16 servos. Each servo takes up 3 pins for ground, power, and signal. By connecting the servos through this method, I can program them using the Adafruit ServoKit library, which lets me set each servo to a specified degree.

## Code


<!--- For your first milestone, describe what your project is and how you plan to build it. You can include:
- An explanation about the different components of your project and how they will all integrate together
- Technical progress you've made so far
- Challenges you're facing and solving in your future milestones
- What your plan is to complete your project -->

<!--- # Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/) -->
